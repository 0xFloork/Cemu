# Cemu - Wii U emulator

This is the official repository for Cemu, a Wii U emulator that runs on x64 Windows and Linux.

[Official website](https://cemu.info/)

## Releases

The latest release is available on the github [releases page](https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/releases/)

Pre-2.0 releases can be found on the [Cemu website](http://cemu.info/changelog.html).

## Build instructions

See [building.md](https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/blob/master/building.md)

## State of linux builds

Linux builds of Cemu are somewhat functional but lack a lot of polish and some features.
Currently we offer prebuilt binaries for ubuntu 20.04. For other distributions you'll have to compile it yourself. In the future we will look into providing appimage and/or flatpak releases.

**Important: Cemu currently requires all files to be placed in a case-insensitive filesystem**
